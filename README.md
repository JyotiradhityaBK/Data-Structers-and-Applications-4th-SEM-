- [Directory Structure](#directory-structure)
- [How to Use](#how-to-use)

## Introduction
In this repository, you will find C code implementations of different data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more. The codes are organized to help you understand the fundamentals of each data structure and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Directory Structure
- **[Week 1](https://github.com/JyotiradhityaBK/Data-Structers-and-Applications-4th-SEM-/tree/main/Week%201):** 

## How to Use
Each week's directory contains the C code files along with a brief description of the purpose and functionality of the code. To use the code, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the specific week's directory.
2. Open the C file(s) in a C compiler or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
3. Compile and run the code to observe the data structure in action.

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from the provided code. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to [create an issue](../../issues).



Happy coding!
